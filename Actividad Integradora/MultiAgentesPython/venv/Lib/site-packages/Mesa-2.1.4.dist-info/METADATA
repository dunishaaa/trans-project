Mesa: Agent-based modeling in Python 3+

Mesa allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Python's data analysis tools. Its goal is to be the Python 3-based alternative to NetLogo, Repast, or MASON.

Features
------------

* Modular components
* Browser-based visualization
* Built-in tools for analysis
* Example model library

Using Mesa
------------

Getting started quickly:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mesa

You can also use `pip` to install the github version:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa@main#egg=mesa

Or any other (development) branch on this repo or your own fork:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/YOUR_FORK/mesa@YOUR_BRANCH#egg=mesa

Running Mesa in Docker
------------------------

You can run Mesa in a Docker container in a few ways.

If you are a Mesa developer, first `install Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ and then, in the folder containing the Mesa Git repository, you run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker compose up
    # If you want to make it run in the background, you instead run
    $ docker compose up -d

This runs the Schelling model, as an example.

With the docker-compose.yml file in this Git repository, the `docker compose up` command does two important things:

* It mounts the mesa root directory (relative to the docker-compose.yml file) into /opt/mesa and runs pip install -e on that directory so your changes to mesa should be reflected in the running container.
* It binds the docker container's port 8765 to your host system's port 8765 so you can interact with the running model as usual by visiting localhost:8765 on your browser


If you are a model developer that wants to run Mesa on a model, you need to:

* make sure that your model folder is inside the folder containing the docker-compose.yml file
* change the ``MODEL_DIR`` variable in docker-compose.yml to point to the path of your model
* make sure that the model folder contains an app.py file

Then, you just need to run `docker compose up -d` to have it accessible from ``localhost:8765``.

Contributing to Mesa
----------------------------

Want to join the Mesa team or just curious about what is happening with Mesa? You can...

  * Join our `Matrix chat room`_ in which questions, issues, and ideas can be (informally) discussed.
  * Come to a monthly dev session (you can find dev session times, agendas and notes on `Mesa discussions`_).
  * Just check out the code on `GitHub`_.

If you run into an issue, please file a `ticket`_ for us to discuss. If possible, follow up with a pull request.

If you would like to add a feature, please reach out via `ticket`_ or join a dev session (see `Mesa discussions`_).
A feature is most likely to be added if you build it!

Don't forget to checkout the `Contributors guide`_.
