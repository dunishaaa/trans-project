    "# Build your Jupyter dashboard using Solara\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **the** first part of a series of tutorial**s** that will show you how to create a dashboard in Jupyter and deploy it as a standalone web **app**. **Importantly, there will be** no need to rewrite your app in a different framework, no need to use a non-Python solution, **and** no need to use JavaScript or CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are an incredible tool for data analysis, **since they enable** blending code, visualization and narrative in**to** a single document.\n",
    "However, if the insights need to be presented to a non-technical audience, we usually do not want to show the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will create a simple dashboard using Solara's UI components. **The final product will** allow an end-user to filter,\n",
    "visualize and explore a dataset on a map.\n",

    "\n",
